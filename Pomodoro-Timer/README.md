A **Pomodoro timer** is a time management tool that helps people break down work into manageable intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s and is called the "Pomodoro Technique," named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used to time his work intervals.

### Why is it Useful ? 
The Pomodoro Technique is designed to help people stay focused and avoid distractions by setting a timer for a specific amount of time and working on a single task during that time. After the time is up, a short break is taken, typically 5 minutes, before starting the next work interval.

Using a Pomodoro timer can be helpful in *increasing productivity and reducing procrastination*. The technique encourages people to work in short, focused bursts, which can help maintain concentration and reduce the likelihood of burnout. Additionally, taking regular breaks can help prevent mental fatigue and improve overall work quality.
